# Responsive-Web-Design-Certification-project
This repository showcases my completed projects from the Responsive Web Design Certification by freeCodeCamp.org. Over the course of 300+ hours, I built and debugged accessible, semantic, and responsive web interfaces using HTML and CSS â€” with a strong emphasis on modular structure, clean formatting, and inclusive design.
